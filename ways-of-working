-- Describe Distributed Workflow

a) Which repository setup will we use?
  TBD. 

b) Which branching model will we use?
  - original branch: original code 
  - main branch: up-to-date code, PR setup  
  - work branches 
  
  Naming conventions: 
  <week>-<feature> 
  
  PR: 
  - peer review of a person who wasn't involved 
  - should include a description of the code 

c) Which distributed development workflow will we use?
  - weekly meetings (besides the exercises) with a stand-up
  - stand-up: 
    - status 
    - PRs
  - We use Teams for communication 
  - We try to be here physically, but alternatively online 

d) How do we expect contributions to look like?
  - We use PRs, see above. 

e) Who is responsible for integrating/reviewing contributions?
  - We are collectively responsible.
  - If we are unable to do it collectively, the one making the PR is responsible for assigning a reviewer. Once it's assigned, it's the reviewer's responsibility.
  - We discuss it at the stand-ups or write on our chat, when a PR is ready. 


Choice of programming language: #C 
- Various experience in C# within the group; we can learn from each other 
- C# is a commonly used language in the industry, so we would like to become more familiar with it
